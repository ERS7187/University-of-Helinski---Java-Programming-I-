The purpose of this repository is to serve as a place to track my progression through The University of Helinskis Java I ( and eventually Java II) programming course.
The course is comprised of open source material, includes hundreds of exercises that are each individually required to pass a series of parameters to recieve credit for the exercise.
The Link to the course can be found here https://java-programming.mooc.fi/
